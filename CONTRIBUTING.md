## Other notes

### Style

Flutter plugins follow Google styleâ€”or Flutter style for Dartâ€”for the languages they
use, and use auto-formatters:
- [Dart](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo) formatted
  with `dart format`
- [Swift] I have no idea ðŸ˜… Just maintain readable format.
